                  Blue ghost males produce a bluish green light (the light is actually green, but appears blue to the human eye). Males fly low to the ground 
                  in search for flightless females on the forest floor. Males may shine a continuous glow for up to 15 seconds at a time. Most active between 
                  late May to mid-June. There are two distinct peaks of the mating season with the second peak being less abundant than the first peak. This species 
                  prefers a variety of Appalachian forest types ranging from moist and dry forests, along water and on high dry ridges. A tiny to small firefly measuring 0.2-0.4 inches long.

                    is a species of firefly (Lampyridae) that is well-known for its unique behavior of synchronous flashing during its mating 
                    display.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Synchronous firefly males produce a flash pattern of 5-10 single flashes, pause for approximately 10 seconds and repeat. Males will 
                    generally fly around 5-6 feet off the ground in search of a females who wait on the forest floor or perched on a blade of grass and 
                    respond with a flash of their own. In areas where population numbers are high, males will begin to flash in “synchrony” and produce
                    a light train that resembles running Christmas lights. Most active toward the end of June. This species prefers the habitat of maturing 
                    cove hardwood forests in live in the forest interior. A large firefly, 0.4-0.6 inches long.

                    People often gather to observe the breathtaking display of synchronous fireflies during their mating season, 
                    which typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Because of their popularity, some areas where these fireflies are found have
                    implemented measures to manage visitor impact and protect the natural habitat. If you are interested in observing synchronous fireflies,
                    it's important to check with local authorities and follow any guidelines to minimize disturbance to these fascinating insects and their environment.

                    The males of this species produce an orange, stuttering flash that lasts for one second, pauses for 2-3 seconds and repeats. Their flash is generally angled diagonally upward or downward. 
                    Commonly observed flying between 6 feet high and the treetops. Females respond to the males flash while perched on vegetation 2-4 feet off the ground. Most common from June to July. Prefers 
                    interior forest habitats or along the forest edge. It is found in a variety of habitats, including moist and dry forests, often in proximity to creeks or marshes. A large firefly 0.5 inches long. 
                    There are reports that this species has become rare and possibly extirpated from large areas in the Mid-Atlantic. In 2018, Pyractomena angulata became 
                    the official state insect of Indiana.
