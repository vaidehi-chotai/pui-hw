                    Allegheny hosts populations of Photinus carolinus, which is responsible for one of nature’s most incredible light shows. While their famous 
                    cousins in Asia light up the environment with continuously synchronous flashes while perched on trees, the display of Photinus carolinus is 
                    a much more complex showing of patterns while in flight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What appears to the untrained eye as whimsical bursts of light is actually a well-crafted communication tool used in search of a mate. Males of 
                    the species display what researchers dub a “flash train.” Thousands of males will produce these flash trains of, on average, six flashes followed 
                    by six to eight seconds of darkness. This continues for several hours into the darkness of night. For the synchronous firefly, it is akin to a Christmas 
                    light display deep in a forest full of towering hemlock and beech. It is stunning and mesmerizing to observe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People often gather to observe the breathtaking display of synchronous fireflies during their mating season, 
                    which typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Because of their popularity, some areas where these fireflies are found have
                    implemented measures to manage visitor impact and protect the natural habitat. If you are interested in observing synchronous fireflies,
                    it's important to check with local authorities and follow any guidelines to minimize disturbance to these fascinating insects and their environment.

                  The name "Big Dipper" is derived from the distinctive flash pattern displayed by <span id="species-name">Photinus pyralis</span> during its mating communication. 
                  The flash pattern is reminiscent of the stars in the Big Dipper constellation. The male fireflies emit a series of quick, bright flashes that resemble the shape of the Big Dipper.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As for its flash pattern, the Big Dipper Firefly exhibits a characteristic series of double flashes. The male fireflies emit short bursts of light in a distinctive pattern, often described 
                  as a double flash, which is thought to play a crucial role in their courtship and mating behavior. The exact pattern can vary among individual firefly species, helping them identify potential
                  mates and ensuring successful reproduction.

                  <br>
                  In terms of abundance, Photinus pyralis is considered a common firefly species in its range. However, like many fireflies, its populations can be affected by factors such as habitat loss, 
                  pesticide use, and light pollution. Conservation efforts are important to ensure the continued presence of these enchanting insects in their natural habitats.

                    The males of this species produce an orange, stuttering flash that lasts for one second, pauses for 2-3 seconds and repeats. Their flash is generally angled diagonally upward or downward. 
                    Commonly observed flying between 6 feet high and the treetops. Females respond to the males flash while perched on vegetation 2-4 feet off the ground. Most common from June to July. Prefers 
                    interior forest habitats or along the forest edge. It is found in a variety of habitats, including moist and dry forests, often in proximity to creeks or marshes. A large firefly 0.5 inches long. 
                    There are reports that this species has become rare and possibly extirpated from large areas in the Mid-Atlantic. In 2018, Pyractomena angulata became 
                    the official state insect of Indiana.
